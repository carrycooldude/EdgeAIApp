## 🎮 Enhanced Demo Examples

### Structured Story Generation
- **Input**: "Write a short story about a robot"
- **Output**: "Once upon a time, in a futuristic laboratory, there lived a curious robot named ARIA. She had been designed to learn and explore the world around her. Every day, ARIA would venture into the city, observing humans and their daily routines. She marveled at their emotions, their laughter, and their dreams. Through her adventures, ARIA discovered that being truly alive meant not just processing data, but understanding the beauty of human connection and the power of imagination."

### Technical Explanations
- **Input**: "Explain artificial intelligence"
- **Output**: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems use algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions. From virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles, AI is transforming how we interact with technology and solve complex problems in our daily lives."

### Programming Assistance
- **Input**: "How do I write a Python function?"
- **Output**: "To write a Python function, you use the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parameters. Here's a simple example:

```python
def greet_user(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python programming."

# Call the function
message = greet_user("Alice")
print(message)
```

Functions help organize code, make it reusable, and improve readability. You can also add default parameters, return multiple values, and use docstrings to document your functions."
